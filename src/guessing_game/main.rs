        // fixed length "enumeration", the variants here are ('Ok','Err'), with each enumeration also
        // having either the result, or additional information in case of no result.

        // it will take on the associate Error message.

        // such that both secret_num and guess can be evaluated by ::cmp::Ordering, as Ordering needs
        // it's operands to be share a common numeric type.

        // parse method then parses the string into some numeric type, here it's u32, and has an
        // associated Result type, in case a non-numeric input is given.

        // in the event when parse is not able to turn the string into a number, it will cause
        // match to go to second arm's pattern, Err(_) where, "_" is a catchall, which means Err
        // will always match, no matter what, should the Ok arm fail to match due to parse failing
        // to convert string into a number.

// for the dependency part where we import the rand lib
// by defining it in the cargo.toml file's dependencies section.
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html
// we have specified our version requirements to be open by using "0"

// Cargo only updates the build with whatever tiny change there is to the src/main.rs file.
// If our dependencies havenâ€™t changed Cargo will know that, and will reuse what it can
// by rebuilding our part of the code, that has actually changed, this information is
// kept in the cargo lock file, so as to be able to keep track of dependency drift
// and ensure reproducibility in builds, the lock can be bypassed by using the "cargo update"
// command, by default cargo will stick closely to the semver specifed, which in our case is loose
// so it will update to whatever version is the latest, which has the potential to break our code.
